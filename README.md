## About

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website. It is designed to be responsive for all screen sizes and features a card-like UI separated into four parts:

1. Profile Page

3. Skills and Experience
4. Projects

In the future, I plan to convert this website into a React application.

Feel free to explore the code.
